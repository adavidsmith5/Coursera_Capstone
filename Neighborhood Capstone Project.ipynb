If you are in a big city that you've never been to, you may not want to try to figure out how to get around whether by taxi, bus, or some other public transportation. You may even just want to avoid spending money on getting around and instead be able to walk everywhere you want to visit. For that reason, we can compare your preferences to the different areas of the city you want to visit and what they have to offer to make a recommendation of where you may want to get a hotel. These preferences could be from a previous trip, so, for example, if you visited New York City last year and want to go to Toronto this year, you could compare neighborhoods that you went to and enjoyed in New York to the neighborhoods in Toronto to see where you might prefer to stay."
